    <d1>Hello, and welcome to Rune Search! I am Goat.</d1>
    <d2>I AM HUNGRYYYYYY!</d2>
    <d3>I love to eat letters! Use the arrow keys to help me find them. (I can't see very well...)</d3>
    <d4>If YOU need to go eat something, press 'p' to pause the game.</d4>
    <d5>Oh and also, watch out for any weirdos lurking around in the letters. You never really know what is out there...</d5>
    <d6>Y'all ready?</d6>
